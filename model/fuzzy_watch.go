// replay a late-joining watcher receives for already-known matches),
// or constant.FUZZY_WATCH_RESOURCE_CHANGED for a post-init change notify.

// FuzzyWatchLoadEvent is delivered to a load-event callback when the server
// reports that a fuzzy watch pattern hit a capacity limit (pattern count or

// or ERROR_CODE_FUZZY_WATCH_MATCH_COUNT_OVER_LIMIT.
